2019-03-22 10:01 Crazy week.

So much training. Have to learn more about: 

 - Terraform
 - Azure Data Bricks
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (MUST PASS EXAM)
 - Splunk
 - Vue.js
 - Programming Language Theory

So much to learn and so little time.
Been playing Cogmind though. Super cool game. I want to make that game my terminal. Very good animations for scrolling text!
