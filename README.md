# LambdaCore
A small Lisp written in Rust.

### Plan

- [x] Read Lisp file in. File extension: `.lcore`
- [x] Parse Lisp syntax.
- [x] Agree upon data types.
- [x] Call function from Rust in LambdaCore.
- [ ] Print formatted syntax to HTML with colors.
- [ ] Infinitely Extend. ðŸ˜ƒ
- [ ] Symbol Table (A hidden variable within the scope)
- [x] Built-in functions

##### Quoting

This is going to be an interesting undertaking. Look at quoting, quasi-quoting, back-quoting?

### Runtime

 * Plant variable into root namespace named `SYMBOL_TABLE`.
	* Use this variable to manage the language from within itself.
	* Scopes are lists of symbols just like Craft (aka Wing v1).
 * [Tail-call recursion optimization](https://github.com/murarth/ketos/blob/master/docs/README.md)

### Data Types

 * Null
 * Identifier
 * Boolean
 * Int (x64)
 * Float (x64)
 * String
 * Array
 * Func
 * Struct

### Syntax

```lisp
(print "Hello World")

(loop 3 'i '[
	(print (fmt "Iteration ${i}"))
])

(print (* 10 2))

(type 'person ['name 'age])

(defn 'person-get-age '[some-person] '[
	:: For now:
	(ret (get some-person 'age))

	:: Future:
	(ret some-person/age)
])

:: `new` gets passed the struct definition
(set 'Pebaz (new person "Pebaz" 24))

```
